Like it has been in the past two days, we will be attending a local game fair called GameX Dijital Oyun ve Eğlence Fuarı for the weekend. We have already collected a fair amount of feedback from those who had a visit to our stand, and we think that things are looking great in terms of Smashboard, the game we currently develop.

In between the days of the convention, we develop and fix certain parts of the game to get more viable feedback the day after. So far, we have observed that Smashboard is a challenging but rewarding game. Considering that Smashboard is a game inspired by the souls-like genre in terms of its design, we are happy that we have achieved what we wanted to achieve!

Even if you cannot come to visit us at the convention to play Smashboard, you can join our Discord server to experience an updated version of it daily!
